# 1.1 Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is useful for dealing with large, complex programs.

# 1.2 What is OOP?

## Definitions

**Object-Oriented Programming** is a *programming paradigm* in which:
- problems are dealt with in terms of objects, and
- objects are used to organize a program.

An **object** is a type of data that has two features:
1. **state**, i.e., properties
2. **behavior**, i.e., what it can do

## Use-cases

Contrast with what has come so far:
1. **procedural programming** (step-by-step approach, e.g., with conditionals and loops)
2. **functional programming** (e.g., passing callback functions as arguments to methods)

Benefits of OOP:
1. easy to reason about (through abstraction)
2. easy to maintain (to decrease the number of dependencies)

Tradeoffs:
1. OOP programs are often larger
2. OOP programs are often less efficient (more memory, storage, and processing)

# 1.3 Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the bundling together into a single structure of two things:
1. data (state)
2. operations on that data (behavior)

Purpose of encapsulation:
1. It ensures that you don't perform an operation suited for one type of data on another type of data for which it is unsuited.
2.
