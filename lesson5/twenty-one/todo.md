## My Summary of Steps for Creating an OOP program.

Steps:

1. Write a description of the problem.
2. Extract significant nouns & verbs.
3. Organize & associate nouns & verbs.
4. Write scaffolding stubs and spike code.
    - Outline classes & their methods.
    - Write *stubs*, asking questions about data structures, relations between classes, etc.
    - Write a *spike* in the orchestration engine.
    - Test the code.
    - Take care of low-hanging fruit.
    - Work through the harder problems within the spike, and at each step, outline the pros and cons of different approaches.
