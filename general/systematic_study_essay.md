# The Written Assessment

## Why care about the written exam?

At first, it appeared peculiar to have an essay-style exam to test coding knowledge. And for me, it also appeared to be a digression from making progress in learning to code, since I was anxious after JS101 to continue learn new things. By the time I took the exam, I had realized these appearances were incorrect and that there are substantial benefits to having an essay-style exam for learning the fundamentals of software development.

So, before getting to the particulars of how I studied for the exam, it might be helpful to identify some of these benefits, especially since recognizing them can help one maintain motivation to study for it. I identified five main benefits.

First, the written exam is designed for testing mastery of fundamental concepts. In particular, Launch School's high standards force one to adhere to a high level of precision. And that will provide **a sturdy foundation to build on top of**. For example, lack of a precise understanding of the distinction between statements and expressions in JavaScript is something that appears to thwart those who learn React without such a foundation.[^1]

Second, the written assessment is **good preparation for the interview assessment**. The main thing here is that one becomes *fluent* in talking about coding concepts. A written exam is especially helpful for this. When I learned German years ago, I practiced by writing in e-mails in German to a friend. In these e-mails, I would force myself to use new bits of grammar that I had just begun to learn. By practicing writing using those grammatical structures, I was able very quickly to speak aloud using those same grammatical structures. Likewise, after I prepared extensively for Launch School's written exam, I noticed that I was much more fluent when talking with classmates about coding concepts and code snippets. And when I took the interview exam, I was able to talk precisely while thinking aloud about my problem-solving process.

Third, and following the previous point, the written assessment is **good preparation for job interviews** down the line. Many of the written exam's questions test fundamental concepts that come up in job interviews.[^2]

Fourth, the written assessment **develops one's ability to parse others' code**, which is (from what I understand) a core part of what software developers do on the job, e.g., when learning a codebase at a new job.

Fifth, preparation for the written exam requires **exercising valuable meta-cognitive skills**. In other parlance, it forces you to learn how to learn. One of things I was initially frustrated with is that I wasn't sure how to go about studying for the written assessment. But such open-endedness is often valuable, since it forces one to reflect on the material being tested on, e.g., reflecting on which aspects of the material to prioritize.

## Skills for mastery

Following on the last benefit above, it is worth noting a few skills that promote mastery when learning something new. As you'll see below, many of these skills I explicitly cultivated or used in how I prepared for the assessments.

1. **Asking questions**: To learn something new and with mastery, it helps to identify what you don't yet fully comprehend and articulate it as a question to be answered.
2. **Paying attention to language**: One's understanding of something is only as good as the ability to articulate that understanding in language, so mastery requires attention to using precise language.
3. **Writing things out**: Building on the previous point, writing out your questions and understanding of a topic forces you to think about subtle distinctions that might go unnoticed if your thinking is confined within your head.
4. **Crafting one's own explanations & examples**: In coming up with your own explanations & examples of a concept, you need to think about what is essential to that concept, versus what was inessential in other examples encountered in the past.
5. **Circular learning and spaced repetition**: Reviewing the material and using flashcard (e.g., Anki) helps one internalize the material at a deeper level within one's memory.

One way to sum up all of the above is that **mastery of a topic comes about when you make it your own**. That is, you need to process for yourself the material rather than simply repeating or regurgitating it. I'll return to this point below.

## Steps

### Step 1: Active review

Docs 1-3

Go through:
- textbook
- lessons
- discussion posts
- any notes made during 100 & 101

Add new Anki cards as needed
pay attention to bold words (perhaps save for third review with explanation snippets)

Strategy document: add small lessons from different sources

### Step 2: Practice

Docs 4-8

Add to language & question documents: practicing will force one to pay attention to things that might be tricky to articulate precisely

### Step 3: Consolidation

Docs 9-10

Lack of precise definitions in the LS materials is actually helpful

Tactics for concise explanations:

- "This means that..."
- "This contrasts with..."

### Step 4: Mock exam

Doc 11

### Step 5: Final preparations

Docs 12-13

# The Interview Assessment

```
├── interview_to_do.md
└── my_pedac.md
```

- Identify strategies for getting unstuck
- collect classic problems
- make own methods
- keep a list of problems to redo
- Do [List Processing Small Problems](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/ea72ee67) and practice two things:
  1. Write algorithms using different methods
  2. Pay attention to patterns of my algorithms that suggest different kinds of methods.
