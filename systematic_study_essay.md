# The Written Assessment

## Why care about the written exam?

At first, it appeared peculiar to have an essay-style exam to test coding knowledge. And for me, it also appeared to be a digression from making progress in learning to code, since I was anxious after JS101 to continue learn new things. By the time I took the exam, I had realized these appearances were incorrect and that there are substantial benefits to having an essay-style exam for learning the fundamentals of software development.

So, before getting to the particulars of how I studied for the exam, it might be helpful to identify some of these benefits, especially since recognizing them can help one maintain motivation to study for it. I identified four main benefits.

First, the written exam is designed for testing mastery of fundamental concepts. In particular, Launch School's high standards force one to adhere to a high level of precision. And that will provide **a sturdy foundation to build on top of**. For example, lack of a precise understanding of the distinction between statements and expressions in JavaScript is something that appears to thwart those who learn React without such a foundation.[^1]

Second, the written assessment is **good preparation for the interview assessment**. The main thing here is that one becomes *fluent* in talking about coding concepts. A written exam is especially helpful for this. When I learned German years ago, I practiced by writing in e-mails in German to a friend. In these e-mails, I would force myself to use new bits of grammar that I had just begun to learn. By practicing writing using those grammatical structures, I was able very quickly to speak aloud using those same grammatical structures. Likewise, after I prepared extensively for Launch School's written exam, I noticed that I was much more fluent when talking with classmates about coding concepts and code snippets. And when I took the interview exam, I was able to talk precisely while thinking aloud about my problem-solving process.

Third, and following the previous point, the written assessment is good preparation for job interviews down the line. Many of the written exam's questions test fundamental concepts that come up in job interviews.[^2]

Fourth, 

read code

Fifth,

lack of clear expectations can be helpful, since it forces you to think about what to prioritize

[^2]: Notice how many of the questions on [30 seconds of interviews](https://30secondsofinterviews.org/) are easily answered if you have a mastery of the JS101 material.

## Orientation: Mastery-based learning

### Assumptions

Anki

Small Problems

Only a suggested roadmap, a rational reconstruction

### Tactics for mastery

1. Asking questions
2. Paying attention to language
3. Writing things out
4. Creating one's own explanations & examples
5. Circular learning: going back & forth

All of these involve further processing / making it your own

## Steps

### Step 1: Active review

Docs 1-3

Go through:
- textbook
- lessons
- discussion posts
- any notes made during 100 & 101

Add new Anki cards as needed
pay attention to bold words (perhaps save for third review with explanation snippets)

Strategy document: add small lessons from different sources

### Step 2: Practice

Docs 4-8

Add to language & question documents: practicing will force one to pay attention to things that might be tricky to articulate precisely

### Step 3: Consolidation

Docs 9-10

Lack of precise definitions in the LS materials is actually helpful

Tactics for concise explanations:

- "This means that..."
- "This contrasts with..."

### Step 4: Mock exam

Doc 11

### Step 5: Final preparations

Docs 12-13

# The Interview Assessment

```
├── interview_to_do.md
└── my_pedac.md
```

- Identify strategies for getting unstuck
- collect classic problems
- make own methods
- keep a list of problems to redo
- Do [List Processing Small Problems](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/ea72ee67) and practice two things:
  1. Write algorithms using different methods
  2. Pay attention to patterns of my algorithms that suggest different kinds of methods.
