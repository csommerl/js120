# Why care about the written exam?

It is initially peculiar to have an essay-style exam to test coding knowledge. And (at least for me) I was anxious after JS101 to continue either learning new things or doing more coding problems. So, it's worth recognizing the benefits of such an exam, and being conscious of them can help maintain motivation to studying for it.

Three benefits that I focused on are these. First,

...

2. 1. interview prep
   1. compare to learning German

2. precision that will help later, e.g., https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/

- psychology of wanting to make progress
- lack of clear expectations can be helpful, since it forces you to think about what to prioritize

3. Read code

# Orientation: Mastery-based learning

## Assumptions

Anki

Small Problems

Only a suggested roadmap, a rational reconstruction

## Tactics for mastery

1. Asking questions
2. Paying attention to language
3. Writing things out
4. Creating one's own explanations & examples
5. Circular learning: going back & forth

All of these involve further processing / making it your own

# Steps

## Step 1: Active review

Docs 1-3

Go through:
- textbook
- lessons
- discussion posts
- any notes made during 100 & 101

Add new Anki cards as needed
pay attention to bold words (perhaps save for third review with explanation snippets)

Strategy document: add small lessons from different sources

## Step 2: Practice

Docs 4-8

Add to language & question documents: practicing will force one to pay attention to things that might be tricky to articulate precisely

## Step 3: Consolidation

Docs 9-10

Lack of precise definitions in the LS materials is actually helpful

Tactics for concise explanations:

- "This means that..."
- "This contrasts with..."

## Step 4: Mock exam

Doc 11

## Step 5: Final preparations

Docs 12-13

# Interview Prep

```
├── coding_tips.md
├── interview_to_do.md
└── my_pedac.md
```

- Identify strategies for getting unstuck
- collect classic problems
- make own methods
- keep a list of problems to redo
- Do [List Processing Small Problems](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/ea72ee67) and practice two things:
  1. Write algorithms using different methods
  2. Pay attention to patterns of my algorithms that suggest different kinds of methods.
